Description: Computation of a cubic B-spline basis for arbitrary knots. It also provides the 1st and 2nd derivatives, as well as the integral of the basis elements. It is used by the author to fit penalized B-spline models, see e.g. Jullion, A. and Lambert, P. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2006.09.027>,  Lambert, P. and  Eilers, P.H.C. (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.11.022> and, more recently, Lambert, P. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107250>. It is inspired by the algorithm developed by de Boor, C. (1977) <doi:10.1137/0714026>.
