# R-Package for the computation of cubic B-splines, their derivatives and their integrals.

Computation of a cubic B-spline basis associated to a given vector of knots.
In addition to the basis, the first and second derivatives and the integral of B-splines can also be calculated using
  Bsplines, D1Bsplines, D2Bsplines, IBsplines
